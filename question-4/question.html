  A recent study published on Research Gate,
  shows how an incredible amount of inappropriate videos is actually reached by children on Youtube,
  collecting millions of views before they even get discovered,
  reported and removed from the platform.
  The danger for kids is real and YT does not provide content curations service to prevent it.
  “Elsagate” sub-Reddit still seems to be the right place to speak about those problems,
  targeting the right ways to make a report, even if not all users respect the rules ▎
</p>
<div class="main-text-title"><h3>Main findings</h3></div>
<div class="main-text">
  <p>
    The majority of videos reported on “Elsagate” sub-Reddit are related to sexual contents.
    Their thumbnails are the most explicit ones,
    easier to detect and clearly more defined than the ones related to other problematics.

    There is not a strict correlation between the number of upvotes registered by a post and the fact the video reported in it has been deplatformed or not.
    Anyway, it has been noticed that most of the contents reported is now offline.

    The sub-Reddit defines guidelines to understand which videos could be marked as “Elsagate”.
    However some users still report contents that are not actually respecting the given criteria.
    Majority of those are still online, despite the high amount of upvotes.

    There are just 2 out 145 posts that are wrongly reported, because they miss indications to retrace them on YT,
    like video title or channel’s name. Since this percentage is so small, 
    this sub-Reddit still represents an effective tool to have a complete overview on this kind of content.
