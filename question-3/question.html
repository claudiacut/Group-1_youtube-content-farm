  Thumbnails are among the first things that a user sees of a video and the only one that a kid of an early age could understand. Considering the importance of Cocomelon on Youtube and being an analysis of this kind missing at the moment, we tried to collect them all from the beginning, even before the start of its fame, to see which strategies could be revealed and which elements were changed or kept in order to lead to their success ▎

  <p>
    Cocomelon has been increasing the number of its publications over years. At the beginning, just a few videos were uploaded, then, from 2015 a change in strategy is evident, moving from 25 videos to a number of around 100 per year.

   The increase of publications also corresponds to a reduction in variability of main subjects presented and an increased repetition of the same format over time.

    From 2017, a slight change of strategy is evident: together with the passage to 3d images, thumbnails started focusing on characters’ centrality, presenting always recurrent layouts where few empty spaces are left from protagonists’ big faces.

    Standardisation of thumbnails could be seen not only in layout formats and subjects relevancy in the occupation of their space, but even in colors. A shift to warm tones is evident, in respect of early videos published.
