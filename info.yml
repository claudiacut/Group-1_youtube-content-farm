title: Inside the Tube
subtitle: An analysis through Youtube Content Farms made for Kids

description: "Youtube is one of the most used platforms to entertain kids, so popular that it overcame television. Parents and babysitters give their child access to it, trusting its system and educational purposes, but a great percentage of them do not actually supervise this activity. Left alone in front of the screen, children go through a great amount of videos, consuming everything recommended, as decided by Youtube’s algorithm. Even considering just videos for kids, a label that channels arbitrary chose and that is not under strict control of YT, some peculiar aspects can be detected and this study aims to analyze them. Channels’ owners know exactly what children like and this also match easily with what YT algorithm want. It is not a matter of quality, but just automation to make everyone happy with the least effort. Poor quality of videos is not the only problem to face: some channels create misleading contents, managing to be reached by young users and shock them ▎"
