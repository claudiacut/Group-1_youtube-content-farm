  title: Which words have been used the most in the titles of top YT channels for kids during last month?
  description: One of the first operations to get more views is choosing the right title. In this study we demonstrate how top 10 channels “Made for kids” choose theirs in a short period of time, revealing their strategy. Patterns have been put under the spotlight, not only in terms of words used, but even in successful channels’ behaviours. A comparative study has been done, eased by a full visualisation of channels’ titles, taken from YT and just set side by side.

  title: How has Cocomelon been re-using its most popular song format over and over in time with almost no variation?
  description: Cocomelon is the second most watched channel on Youtube and it is specialised in songs. Its popularity is so great that it got into merchandising and, from June 2020, it collects views even on Netflix. Anyhow, like most of the channels, it does not lose occasions to exploit trends, setting quality aside. In this study we argue how it is possible to hide behind children’s love for repetitions, to work less and appeal the algorithm more.

  title: How did Cocomelon’s thumbnails evolve from 2006 until now and which strategies could be detected?
  description: Since its great success, combined with a blurry ownership past, it seemed interesting to us to go deeper into Cocomelon’s mechanisms. We then went back in history to check how the channel changed its thumbnails over time, until it found the perfect format. Thumbnails are indeed fundamental to set an aesthetic and to reach early age children, still not able to read.

  title: What are the most common reasons for which a YT video is reported on r/ElsaGate sub-Reddit?
  description: The phenomenon of channels tricking children using their favourite cartoons characters to convey wrong messages, unfortunately has a long life. r/Elsagate sub-Reddit was one of the first to mobilize people against this and still now represents a good platform to raise consciousness. Here all “parental warning” posts of the platform are analysed, offering visual references and questioning the usefulness of this tool.
